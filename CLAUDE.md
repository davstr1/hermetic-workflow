# Project

> Written by the Rules Guide. What we're building, one paragraph.

<!-- The Rules Guide will replace this. -->

## Screens

> ASCII doodles and user flows from the Product Vision agent.

<!-- The Product Vision agent will write this. -->

## Tech Stack

> Technology decisions from the Tech Stack agent.

<!-- The Tech Stack agent will write this. -->

## Structure

> Folder layout, file naming, where source/tests/config live.

<!-- The Rules Guide will write this. Example:

```
src/
  components/     UI components
  lib/            Shared utilities
  routes/         Page routes
  types/          TypeScript types
tests/            Test files (or colocated as *.test.ts)
public/           Static assets
```

Naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components.
Tests: colocated as `<module>.test.ts` or in `tests/`.
Config: root level (tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, etc.)
-->

## Principles

> Coding rules that all agents must follow.

<!-- The Rules Guide will write 5-10 specific, enforceable rules here. -->
