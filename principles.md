# Project Principles

> This file is generated by the Architect agent during setup.
> Run `./orchestrator.sh` to start the interactive setup process.

<!-- The Architect will replace this template with project-specific principles. -->
<!-- Each principle should be specific, enforceable, and testable. -->

## Template

When the Architect runs, it will work with you to define principles like:

- **Naming**: How functions, files, and variables should be named
- **Structure**: How code should be organized
- **Quality**: What standards code must meet
- **Patterns**: What patterns to use (and avoid)
- **UI/UX**: Design system rules (enforced by nexum-lint)

*This file will be populated during the Architect setup phase.*
